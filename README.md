# Lists of the most frequently used (top) English words

Data source: [Google ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams) [English data set version 20120701](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html), years 1950 to 2012.

This compilation is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

These collections can save you time and data, if you don't want to download and process the google ngram data yourself.
The scripts to generate the wordlists are also available. The wordlists may need additional filtering depending
on your planned use (e.g. in the dataset there are some non-english characters and words, letters followed by numbers, symbols, www addresses etc.).

If you are looking for more sanitised data, for a spell checker for example, or want forms/variations of a word, check out [SCOWL and friends](http://wordlist.aspell.net/).

The words are sorted so the most frequently used words appear first.
